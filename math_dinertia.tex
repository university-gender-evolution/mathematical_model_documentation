\section*{Abstract}

The past few decades have witnessed substantial improvements in the gender
diversity of newly minted Ph.Ds from top universities. At the same time, the
gender diversity of faculty in these same universities does not
reflect this change in candidate supply. The model developed below examines the
change in faculty gender diversity over time, given as set of initial conditions
and model parameters.

\section{Gender Diversity Evolution Model}
\label{sec:genduniv-model}

In the next two sections we lay out the structure and dynamics of the
demographic inertia model for gender balance in academic faculty. In the first
section we describe the organization and actors in an academic department. Based
upon this organization we outline the evaluation metric to study the
department's gender balance. In the second section we define the dynamics of the
model, namely the way that faculty join and enter the department on a year by
year basis. As we simulate faculty turnover, we evaluate the evolution of gender
balance using our evaluation metric. 

\subsection{Academic Department Composition and Structure}
\label{sec:dept-structure}

An academic department is composed of faculty who teach
and conduct research in a specific discipline. All professors hold a position on the academic career ladder.  This typically includes three steps:  Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Full Professor. The most junior rank is Assistant Professors who are tenure-track faculty, but not yet tenured. In many departments, tenure decisions are made six or seven years after the initial hire date. The second rank is Associate Professors who have been awarded tenure or promoted from Assistant Professor without tenure. The final rank is Full Professors whose position resides at the apex of the promotion ladder.

To formalize the description above, we define $\bm{n^r}$ as the number of professors
at a given rank, where rank $1$ represents an assistant professor and rank $3$ represents
a full professor. The number $\bm{n^r}$ is equal to the sum of women $\bm{n_f^r}$  and men $\bm{n_m^r}$ who are professors at that rank. At any given rank, the number of professors is equal to:
\begin{align}
  n^1 & = n^1_f + n^1_m \label{eq:dept-size-1} \\
  n^2 & = n^2_f + n^2_m  \label{eq:dept-size-2} \\
  n^3 & = n^3_f + n^3_m \label{eq:dept-size-3}
\end{align}

The total size of the department ($\bm{N}$) is equal to the number of professors at
each rank:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:total-dept-size}
  N = n^1 + n^2 + n^3
\end{equation}

By substituting equations
\ref{eq:dept-size-1}, \ref{eq:dept-size-2}, and \ref{eq:dept-size-3} into equation \ref{eq:total-dept-size} we obtain a gendered version of department size equation where the number of women in the department is $\bm{n_f}$ and the number of men is $\bm{n_m}$:

\begin{align}
  n_m &= n^1_m + n^2_m + n^3_m  \label{eq:female-number} \\
  n_f &= n^1_f + n^2_f + n^3_f  \label{eq:male-number} \\
  N &= n_f + n_m  \label{eq:total-gender-dept-size}
\end{align}

This project explores how the proportion of  faculty who are women and men changes over time.  To measure this balance we use the proportions derived from equations \ref{eq:female-number} and \ref{eq:total-gender-dept-size}. 

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:pct-female}
  \text{Proportion of women faculty} &= \frac{n_f}{N} \label{eq:pct-female} \\
  \text{Proportion of men faculty} &= 1 - \frac{n_f}{N}          
\end{align}

\subsection{Department Dynamics}
\label{sec:dept-dynamics}

Department size changes yearly through attrition, promotions and hiring. We begin with the department's actual historical rates of attrition, promotion and hiring and then track how these rates affect the proportion of women faculty over time. The simulation also provides a tool for assessing how changes in the rates of attrition, promotion and hiring influence this outcome.

In order to account for the passage of time, we include time, defined as the sequence of years, beginning with each academic year.  All changes in department size occur after the beginning of time $t$ and before the beginning of time $t+1$. In other words:

\begin{equation*}
  N(t) = n^1(t) + n^2(t) + n^3(t) \label{eq:test}
\end{equation*}

The simulation projects change through three steady-state processes of entry and exit:
attrition, hiring, and promotion. Yearly changes occur after the beginning of time $t$ and before the beginning of time $t+1$.  The equations are a recursive definition of
the number of women and men who are professors at each rank at time $t+1$, based on
changes occurring after the beginning of time $t$. The equations below define a system of discrete
linear difference equations. 

\begin{align} 
  n^1_f(t+1) &= n^1_f(t) - a^1_f(t) + h^1_f(t) - b^{1,2}_f(t)  \label{eq:nf1} \\
  n^1_m(t+1) &= n^1_m(t) - a^1_m(t) + h^1_m(t) - b^{1,2}_m(t) \label{eq:nm1} \\
  n^2_f(t+1) &= n^2_f(t) - a^2_f(t) + h^2_f(t) - b^{2,3}_f(t) + p^{1,2}_f(t) \label{eq:nf2} \\ 
  n^2_m(t+1) &= n^2_m(t) - a^2_m(t) + h^2_m(t) - b^{2,3}_m(t) + p^{1,2}_m(t)  \label{eq:nm2} \\ 
  n^3_f(t+1) &= n^3_f(t) - a^3_f(t) + h^3_f(t) + b^{2,3}_f(t) \label{eq:nf3} \\
  n^3_m(t+1) &= n^3_m(t) - a^3_m(t) + h^3_m(t) + b^{2,3}_m(t) \label{eq:nm3}
\end{align}

[EDIT AFTER REVISIONS TO PARAMETER NAMES]. In equations \ref{eq:nf1}-\ref{eq:nm3} above, the $\bm{a^r_g}$ term refer to the number of professor
attritions in year $t$, while the $\bm{h^r_g}$ term refers to the number of
professor hires. The $\bm{b^{r, r+1}}$ terms refer to promotions between
professor levels. As per the equations, the number of professors promoted from a
given rank will augment the faculty numbers of the higher rank and decrement the
faculty numbers of their current rank. Further, professors cannot be promoted
into the Assistant professor rank and cannot be promoted beyond the Full
professor rank for obvious reasons. 

Next we refine equations \ref{eq:nf1}-\ref{eq:nm3} by modeling the calculation of
attrition, hiring, and promotions. In modeling each of these processes, we also
explain how factors like department growth targets and exogenous faculty churn
also affect department faculty numbers and gender balance. 

\subsubsection{Attrition Process($a^r$)}
\label{sec:attrition}

As professors retire from the department or leave due to new opportunities, the
department size will fall. These departures occur at all ranks, though most
attrition occurs at the full professor level--since this group represents the
largest group of professors in the department. The downward increment in
department size at a given rank and gender is denoted $\bm{a^r_g}$. The number
of attritions $a^r_g \in \zp$ at a given rank and gender are defined by the
following system of equations.

\begin{align}
  a^1_f(t) &= \binomial{n^1_f(t)}{p^{1, attr}_f} + \binomial{cn^1_f(t)}{\frac{n^1_f(t)}{N(t)}}  \label{eq:attr_f1}\\
  a^1_m(t) &= \binomial{n^1_m(t)}{p^{1, attr}_m} + \binomial{cn^1_m(t)}{\frac{n^1_m(t)}{N(t)}} \label{eq:attr_m1} \\
  a^2_f(t) &= \binomial{n^2_f(t)}{p^{2, attr}_f} + \binomial{cn^2_f(t)}{\frac{n^2_f(t)}{N(t)}} \label{eq:attr_f2} \\
  a^2_m(t) &= \binomial{n^2_m(t)}{p^{2, attr}_m} + \binomial{cn^2_m(t)}{\frac{n^2_m(t)}{N(t)}} \label{eq:attr_m2} \\
  a^3_f(t) &= \binomial{n^3_f(t)}{p^{3, attr}_f} + \binomial{cn^3_f(t)}{\frac{n^3_f(t)}{N(t)}} \label{eq:attr_f3} \\
  a^3_m(t) &= \binomial{n^3_m(t)}{p^{3, attr}_m} + \binomial{cn^3_m(t)}{\frac{n^3_m(t)}{N(t)}} \label{eq:attr_m3} 
\end{align}

The first term in each equation is the structural [expected?] number of attritions, given the attrition rate. Since
attritions must be integers, we use a binomial distribution [IS BINOMIAL A PROPER NOUN, i.e. should it be capitalized?)], which determines the
number of successes in a given number of trials. The benefit of using a
probability distribution is that it adds a stochastic character to the model
outcomes. We use the empirically determined attrition rate for each rank and
group $\bm{p^{r,attr}_g}$, in each binomial distribution. Notably, the attrition
rates do not sum to one, otherwise there would an unrealistic level of attrition
each year.

The second term represents unexpected attrition in the department beyond what is projected given the attrition rate. This term modulates additional stochasticity to evaluate how perturbations affect the stability of the system's outputs. The level of churn is determined with regard to the
overall department size. Hence the adjustable parameter $\bm{c}$ represents the
fraction of the department that is susceptible to random churn, for example 5 or 10
percent. $N$ represents the size of the entire department and the distribution
of the additional stochasticity is proportional to the fraction of the
department size that each group constitutes. 

\subsubsection{Hiring Process ($h^r_g$)}
\label{sec:hiring}

The hiring process also must produce an integer number of hires, and hence also
relies on a binomial process.


\begin{align}
  h^1_f(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^1_f(t) + gN(t)}{p^{1, hiring}_f}  \label{eq:hiring_f1}\\
  h^1_m(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^1_m(t) + gN(t)}{p^{1, hiring}_m}  \label{eq:hiring_m1}\\
  h^2_f(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^2_f(t) + gN(t)}{p^{2, hiring}_f}  \label{eq:hiring_f2}\\
  h^2_m(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^2_m(t) + gN(t)}{p^{2, hiring}_m}  \label{eq:hiring_m2}\\
  h^3_f(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^3_f(t) + gN(t)}{p^{3, hiring}_f}  \label{eq:hiring_f3}\\
  h^3_m(t) &= \binomial{A(t) + cn^3_m(t) + gN(t)}{p^{3, hiring}_m}  \label{eq:hiring_m3}\\
  &\sum_{r \in R}\sum_{g \in G}p_g^{r, hiring} = 1 \label{eq:hiring_constraint}
\end{align}

The first term in the the equations \ref{eq:hiring_f1}-\ref{eq:hiring_m3} is the
total number of attritions in the department $A$. The first task of the hiring
process is to fill any voids left by the departures of professors. The second
term in the hiring equation is again a churn term, to model any additional
volatility or stochasticity in the number of possible hires in a given year. The
final term is a growth term $gN(t)$, as departments tend to grow or shrink in
size over time, given prevailing university investments and budgeting
priorities. The $g$ in the equation is the growth rate for the department. The
growth rate times the department size indicates the number of additional
professors to hire in excess of any attritions that need filling. This term
$gN(t)$ must be rounded to the nearest integer value.

The hiring rates $p^{r, hiring}_g$ reflect the tendency for the department to
hire most professors at the Assistant professor level, though the majority of
attritions occur at the Full professor level. This aspect of the model mirrors
the actual hiring processes in most academic departments.

One aspects of the hiring equations bear some explanation. In each equation the
total attrition term is the same, namely $A$. While this may seem like the
equation hires $A$ number of individuals at each level, this is not the case.
Because the hiring rates are different by group, and these rates sum to $1$, the
total number of hires is equal to $A$--independent of any contribution from the
churn and growth terms. These hires are simply peppered over the levels
commensurate with the hiring rates for each group and level. The hires
associated with churn and growth are similarly distributed over the department
groups. 

\subsubsection{Promotion Process($b^r_g$)}
\label{sec:promotion}

The promotion process simply redistributes professors between levels instead of
adding or removing professors from the department. The promotion process simply
promotes a certain fraction of professors at the Assistant or Associate levels
to the their respective increments in each year.

\begin{align}
  b^1_f(t) &= \binomial{n^1_f(t)}{p^{1,2}_f}  \label{eq:attr_f1}\\
  b^1_m(t) &= \binomial{n^1_m(t)}{p^{1, 2}_m}  \label{eq:attr_m1} \\
  b^2_f(t) &= \binomial{n^2_f(t)}{p^{2, 3}_f}  \label{eq:attr_f2} \\
  b^2_m(t) &= \binomial{n^2_m(t)}{p^{2, 3}_m}  \label{eq:attr_m2}
\end{align}


\section{Differences Between New Model and Previous Model}
\label{sec:differences}

The formulation of the current model resolves some issues and inconsistencies in
the previous model. In this section we identify the differences between the
current models and the previous model. The governing system of linear difference
equations \ref{eq:nf1}-\ref{eq:nm3} on page \pageref{eq:nf1} have not changed
between models. The same processes of attrition, hiring, and promotion
contribute to the dynamics of the model as before.

These differences between models cluster around the way that the churn and
growth processes are included in the model. In the original model, the a single
churn variable captured both hiring and attrition. That variable took states of
$-1, 0, 1$, where $-1$ roughly represented one extra attrition and $+1$
represented roughly one additional hire. However this formulation led to an unintended
coupling between the attrition and hiring processes, a coupling that is not
reflective of the actual processes in an academic department. The new model
introduces a separate churn term for the attrition process and a separate churn
term for the hiring process. Both churn terms follow the same distribution, but
in opposite directions. Hence as long as the sum of both terms averages to zero,
the churn processes add no bias or drift to the model.

The second change is the decoupling of the growth process from the churn
process. In the previous model the number of additional FTEs due to growth was
added to the number of FTE changes due to the churn process. This had the
unintended consequence of coupling growth to both the attrition and hiring
processes as well. While a correlation between hiring and growth is
unavoidable--since both processes add professors to the department, the
correlation with attrition was unintended. The new model removes this coupling.
